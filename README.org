* Mercedes-Benz 124 A/C data stream decoder

This crude, currently a work-in-progress, Python program decodes the
data stream output from some air conditioner control units used in
Mercedes-Benz model 124. Reverse engineering documentation about the
data stream format and contents is available in doc/. Captures of data
streams for offline testing are available in testdata/.

Documentation of a known working hardware solution, a simple
diode-zener-resistor circuit to convert the 7.2Â Vp-p serial data
signal to TTL, will be added later.

At this point support cannot be provided and documentation is limited.

Suggestions for improvement may be done by submitting an issue.


* decoder.py

The decoder requires Python 3.10 (match-case is used) and currently
depends on ~argparse~, ~curses~, ~serial~, and ~time~. The program is
known to run on Debian bookworm and Arch Linux.

Offline testing of the decoder can be done by supplying the program a
capture of a data stream, for example:

: ./decoder.py -f testdata/driving.bin

Run ~./decoder.py -h~ for other options.
