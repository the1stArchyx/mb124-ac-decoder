* Mercedes-Benz 124 A/C data stream decoder

This crude Python program decodes the data stream output from some air
conditioner control units used in Mercedes-Benz model 124. Reverse
engineering documentation about the data stream format and contents is
available in doc/. Captures of data streams for offline testing are
available in testdata/.

Documentation of a known working hardware solution, a simple
diode-zener-resistor circuit to convert the 7.2Â Vp-p serial data
signal to TTL, will be added later.

This is purely a research project and therefore proper support cannot
be guaranteed and documentation will most likely be limited.

Suggestions for improvement may be done by submitting an issue.


* decoder.py

The decoder requires Python 3.10 (match-case is used) and currently
depends on ~argparse~, ~curses~, ~serial~, and ~time~. The program is
developed and known to run on Debian 12 bookworm and Arch Linux.

Offline testing of the decoder can be done by supplying the program a
capture of a data stream, for example:

: ./decoder.py -f testdata/driving.bin

Run ~./decoder.py -h~ for other options.


** In case module ~serial~ is not found

You may need to install this module manually unless it's already
installed in your system.

For Debian 12 bookworm (and trixie/testing at the time of writing
this):

: apt install python3-serial

For Arch Linux:

: pacman -S python-pyserial

For other distributions you may need to search the appropriate package
from the distribution's repositories.
